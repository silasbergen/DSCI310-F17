Read this [excellent description and analysis](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/analyzing-minards-visualization-of-napoleons-1812-march) by Joanne Cheng, then submit your answers to the following questions on D2L:

1.  What are the variables that are encoded in this visualization?  

2. For each, state whether it is categorical nominal; categorical ordinal; or quantitative.  

3. What elementary perceptual tasks are used to encode each variable? 

4.  Do you agree with Tufte's assessment?  Regardless, find a graph that *you* think is impressive, and include a link.  Briefly describe why it impresses you, using justification that cites concepts discussed in class.
