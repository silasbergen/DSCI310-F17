<p><strong>NOTE: Friday’s 9-11 office hours will be held in the Knowledge, Empowerment, Advocacy, and Pluralism (KEAP) center in Kryszko 162.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Required software</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JMP -</strong> available from WSU network for free. <a href="https://silasbergen.github.io/JMP_installation.html">Download instructions</a></li>
<li><strong>Tinkerplots</strong> - costs $7. <a href="https://silasbergen.github.io/Tinkerplots.pdf">Download instructions</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Optional text</em></strong></p>
<p>There is no text required for this course. However, if you would like to refer to a textbook, a good reference is <em>Unlocking the Power of Data</em> by Lock, Lock, Lock, Lock, and Lock.</p>
<p><strong><em>Prerequisites</em></strong></p>
<p>Qualifying score on the mathematics placement exam or MATH 050.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic Skills Learning Outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>This course can be used to satisfy the University Studies Program’s requirements for Basic Skills in Mathematics or Goal Area 4 under the new General Education Program. This includes requirements and learning activities that will promote your abilities to.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illustrate historical and contemporary applications of mathematical/logical systems;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clearly express mathematical/logical ideas in writing;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explain what constitutes a valid mathematical/logical argument (proof); and</strong></li>
<li><strong>Apply higher-order problem-solving and/or modeling strategies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional learning outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>The successful Stat 110 student will be able to.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>use logical reasoning by studying mathematical patterns and relationships</strong> One of the major goals of statistics is to find patterns and relationships in datasets. Hence almost all lectures, homework problems, and test questions in the course have the study of patterns for variables and relationships between variables as their basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>use mathematical models to describe real-world phenomena and to solve real-world problems - as well as understand the limitations of models in making predictions and drawing conclusions</strong> In all of the textbooks and course notes used in STAT 110 the majority of the problems are real-world based and are “word” problems. Further, all instructors require the students when doing such problems to write conclusions and discuss limitations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>organize data, communicate the essential features of the data, and interpret the data in a meaningful way</strong> This is the heart of STAT 110. The topics covered are chosen so that students who complete the course can organize data, communicate essential features of the data both numerically and graphically and provide interpretations/conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>do a critical analysis of scientific and other research</strong> The scientific method is discussed early in the course. The logic of hypothesis testing is discussed in detail. Further, on tests and written assignments the students are expected to go beyond a simple analysis and provide implications, interpretations, and conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>extract correct information from tables and common graphical displays, such as line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and frequency tables</strong> All of these topics are explicitly taught in STAT 110 and are on the course outline. Please note that “line graphs” is subsumed under “Frequency distributions and histograms”. Also, please note that “scatter plots” are more formally called “Bivariate displays” by statisticians.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>express the relationships illustrated in graphical displays and tables clearly and correctly in words</strong> As can be seen from the course outline, graphical displays and tables cover a significant portion of the course content. As discussed above, interpretation in words is expected by all instructors on homework and tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>use appropriate technology to describe and solve quantitative problems.</strong> As stated on the course outline, “It is required that at least one assignment using an appropriate computer package be included in the course.” In this section of STAT 110, we will primarily use a statistical software package called JMP.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Assessment tasks</em></strong></p>
<p>The following assessments will be used to gauge growth in the Basic Skills and additional learning outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Attendance (10%)</em></p>
<p>Attending class is very important. The lecture notes are “gap style,” meaning there are many places where they are incomplete and answers will be given in class. Although I will try to post completed notes online after the lecture, it is better for your learning if you are in class. Accordingly, to incentivize attendance, lectures will contain many multiple choice or short answer questions that you will need to answer using TopHat. You get 1 point each time you answer a question. At the end of the course, your total participation score will be weighted at 10% of your total grade.</p>
<p><em>Group homework assignments (40%)</em></p>
<p>There are a number of drawbacks to coming to class only to hear me lecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be hard to pay attention</li>
<li>I may not explain concepts in a way that is the best way for <em>you</em> to understand</li>
<li>I get tired of hearing myself talk!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, roughly half of the in-class time will be spent doing group homework assignments. There are a number of benefits to in-class group assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>No (or at least, very little) homework outside of class!<br />
</li>
<li>You get to explain concepts to, and hear explanations from, your classmates. It’s very likely that I will explain a concept in a way you did not understand, but a classmate will explain it to you in a way that you can understand.</li>
<li>Those of you who <em>do</em> understand a concept will understand it <em>ever better</em> when you try to explain it to a classmate!</li>
<li>I am there in class with you, so as to better answer your questions as they arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will alternate between randomly assigning you into groups (usually of 3), and allowing you to select your own groups. Students will submit their assignments to D2L, and all students in a group will get the same homework grade. The homework practice concepts learned in class. Homework assignment will often require use of JMP or Tinkerplots. <strong>Homework that is submitted after I have uploaded a key will receive a 0.</strong></p>
<p><em>Two midterm exams (30%)</em></p>
<p>These exams will require you to demonstrate your <em>understanding</em> of the material as opposed to your ability to <em>memorize</em> certain concepts. The format will primarily be a combination of short answer, multiple choice, and T/F. Exam dates will be announced at least one week in advance. Rescheduling of an exam will be permitted only if there is a family/medical emergency. Also, <strong>you must contact me before the exam is to be taken</strong>. Arrangements will be made for the exam to be taken at an earlier time, if at all possible.</p>
<p><em>Final exam (20%)</em></p>
<p>This exam will include material covered since the second midterm exam as well as material learned over the course of the entire semester.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final grades</em></strong></p>
<p>Final grades will be a percent that accounts for work on homework and exams. Final grades will be assigned as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>90-100%: A</li>
<li>80-89%: Guaranteed at least a B</li>
<li>70-79%: Guaranteed at least a C</li>
<li>60-69%: Guaranteed at least a D</li>
<li>&lt;60%: No lower than F</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Laptops</em></strong></p>
<p>I encourage you to bring your laptop to class every day so that our classroom can function as a computer lab. I expect you to use your laptop in class for <strong>ACADEMIC PURPOSES ONLY</strong>! Also having a FULL BATTERY (or nearly full) is really beneficial!</p>
<p><strong><em>Academic integrity policy</em></strong></p>
<p>All students must abide by Winona State University’s <a href="http://www.winona.edu/sld/academicintegrity.asp">Academic Integrity Policy</a>. Note that both copying another student’s work and allowing someone to copy your work are clear violations of this policy. If there is reasonable evidence of copying another individual’s work, it will be construed as an act of plagiarism. The first occurrence of violating the academic integrity policy will result in a significant loss of points on that specific homework assignment or exam; the second occurrence will result in failure of the course.</p>
<p><strong><em>Expectations</em></strong></p>
<p>In this course, I expect each of you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to genuinely try your hardest and to demand the best of yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>to seek help if you are confused or if you are starting to fall behind. Please make use of my office hours or the tutoring available via WSU Tutoring Services.</p></li>
<li><p>to be an active learner. This involves ATTENDING and PARTICIPATING in class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In return, you can expect the following from me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a sincere desire for you to learn and an effort to support you in your learning.</p></li>
<li><p>an honest attempt to be fair to everyone in the class.</p></li>
<li><p>an effort to make the learning atmosphere productive and enjoyable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>DETAILS ABOUT CAMPUS RESOURCES</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Commitment to inclusive excellence</em></strong></p>
<p>WSU recognizes that our individual differences can deepen our understanding of one another and the world around us, rather than divide us. In this class, people of all ethnicities, genders, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities are strongly encouraged to share their rich array of perspectives and experiences. If you feel your differences may in some way isolate you from WSU’s community or if you have a need of any specific accommodations, please speak with the instructor early in the semester about your concerns and what we can do together to help you become an active and engaged member of our class and community.</p>
