Consider the [Major League Baseball Standings data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yaqv5afaz1rp9j6/MLB-Standings-2016-2017.xlsx?dl=0).  There are two worksheets in this Excel file: one with 2016 standings, and one with 2017 standings.  The important variables in each are the team names (Tm); actual winning percentage (W-L%); and predicted winning percentage (pythWPct), which is each team's predicted winning percentage based on the number of points ("runs") scored by and against that team.  

Questions to be answered (no restrictions!):

* Which teams' winning percentages most improved the most from 2016-2017?  Which teams got much worse?
* Which teams are most underperforming and overperforming their predicted winning percentage in 2017?
